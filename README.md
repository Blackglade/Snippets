Snippets
================
Sometimes, I create slightly useful scripts/programs to accomplish temporarily/slightly useful things. I usually open source whatever I create and update them here on this Github Repo. Some of these projects are unmaintained unless otherwise specified (mostly because they're only slightly useful).
